    "### 1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that enables a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class. The child class can extend or specialize the functionality of the parent class while retaining its characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four reasons why inheritance is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "CODE REUSABILITY: Inheritance facilitates the reuse of existing code in the child class, reducing redundancy and promoting a more efficient coding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "HIERARCHY AND ORGANIZATION: It assists in organizing code in a hierarchical tree structure, making it easier to manage and understand. Classes inherit and specialize behavior as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "PROMOTES POLYMORPHISM: Through inheritance, polymorphism is enhanced. Now, you can use objects of the child class just like objects of the parent class, allowing for greater flexibility in coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "EASE OF MAINTENANCE: Changes made to the parent class automatically reflect in the child class. This streamlines the process of updating, building, and maintaining the codebase.\n"

    "### 2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their differences and advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SINGLE INHERITENCE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Single inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a class inherits properties and behavior from only one parent class. Each class can have only one direct parent class, forming a linear hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ADVANTAGES:\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance simplifies the class hierarchy by maintaining a straightforward parent-child relationship.\n",
    "Ease of Implementation: It's easier to implement and understand since there's no complexity arising from managing multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MULTIPLE INHERITENCE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from more than one parent class. This means a class can have multiple direct parent classes, forming a more complex hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ADVANTAGES:\n",
    "Increased Flexibility: Multiple inheritance enables a class to inherit features from multiple sources, promoting code reuse and allowing for more diverse behavior.\n",
    "Hierarchical Structuring: It allows for the creation of complex class relationships and provides a more comprehensive way to represent real-world scenarios that involve multiple aspects."

    "\n",
    "PRIVATE: Members marked as private are only accessible within the class where they are declared. They cannot be accessed or inherited by any subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "PROTECTED: Protected members are accessible within the class where they're defined and are also available to any subclasses of that class. They're not accessible outside the class hierarchy.\n",
