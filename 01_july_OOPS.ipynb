    "### 1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of Object_oriented programming is to model real_world entities or concepts in software by organizing code into objects that interact with each other.OOP focuses on several key principles to achieve this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstracting real-world entities into objects that encapsulate their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). This allows complex systems to be represented in a simplified manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulating the data (attributes) and methods (functions or behaviors) within an object, hiding the internal state of an object and exposing only necessary interfaces for interaction. This enhances modularity and reduces complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Creating new classes (subclasses or derived classes) based on existing classes (superclasses or base classes). Inheritance allows new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from their parent classes, facilitating code reuse and promoting a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Providing the ability for objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism allows objects to be manipulated uniformly regardless of their specific class, enhancing flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary goal of OOP is to provide a framework that promotes modularity, reusability, maintainability, and scalability of software systems by organizing code around objects that mimic real-world entities and their interactions.\n"
