    "Advantages of Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulate reusable code.\n",
    "Enhance code readability.\n",
    "Modularize programs into smaller, manageable chunks.\n",

    "### 2. When does the code in a function run: when it&#39;s specified or when it&#39;s called?\n",
    "\n",
    "When Does Code in a Function Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in a function runs when the function is called or invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement to Create a Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The def statement is used to create a function in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "Difference Between a Function and a Function Call:\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that performs a specific task when called.\n",
    "A function call is the act of invoking or executing a function.\n",

    "### 5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Global and Local Scopes:\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one global scope in a Python program.\n",
    "Local scopes are created whenever a function is called, and they cease to exist once the function completes execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Local Scope After Function Call:\n",
    "\n",
    "Local scope variables are destroyed once the function call returns, making them inaccessible outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Return Value:\n",
    "\n",
    "A return value is the value that a function returns after its execution.\n",
    "Yes, it's possible to use a return value in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Without a Return Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function lacks a return statement, its return value is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Referencing Global Variables in Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the global keyword to modify a global variable from within a function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Calling a Feature in a Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "If bacon() is a feature in the spam module, it would be called using spam.bacon() after importing the spam module.\n",

    "\n",
    "Handling Errors to Prevent Crashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use try and except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Purpose of try and except Clauses:\n",
    "\n",
    "try allows you to test a block of code for errors.\n",
    "except catches and handles specific exceptions that occur within the try block, preventing the program from terminating abruptly."
